Course: Ruby Programming

Link: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming?ref=lc-pb

Description: In this course you will learn Ruby, the language designed specifically with programmer happiness in mind. By the end of it all, you'll have built some pretty sweet projects including Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, a real web server, and even Chess. You'll be able to put together a Twitter spambot (that really spams!), save and open files, test out your code, separate your spaghetti code into nice modular classes, and even reproduce some basic algorithms and data structures for solving complex problems. Basically, you're going to start feeling a whole lot more like a real programmer and that feeling will be justified.
